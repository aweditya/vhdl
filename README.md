# Programming in VHDL
This repository contains a collection of problems I did in VHDL as part of the course, **EE 214 - Digital Systems Lab** conducted by the wonderful faculty at _Wadhwani Electronics Lab (WEL)_, IIT Bombay. The course has been designed to complement the theory course, **EE 224 - Digital Systems** running in the same semester and teach students about how logic circuits are designed and synthesised in the industry today. The curriculum covers both, _Structural_ and _Behavioural_ modelling paradigms by implementing circuits consisting of single gates to complex Finite State Machines (FSMs).
